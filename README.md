Here's a structured guide for creating a comprehensive README file for your "FloodGuard" project:

FloodGuard: Flood Prediction System Using IoT and Machine Learning
Overview
FloodGuard is an intelligent flood prediction system designed to provide accurate, real-time flood risk assessments by integrating real-time environmental data from IoT sensors with historical weather data. The system enables timely preventive measures by alerting users when potential flooding is predicted.

Features
Real-Time Data Collection: Collects data from IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water level, rainfall).
Cloud Integration: Utilizes cloud platforms (AWS RDS, Thingspeak, Firebase, Azure SQL) for data storage and management.
Data Processing & Analysis: Cleans, preprocesses, and integrates real-time and historical data.
Machine Learning: Trains predictive models (Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for accurate flood forecasting.
Automated Alerts: Sends notifications to users when flood risk is detected, enabling prompt preventive actions.
Tech Stack
Hardware: IoT Sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water level, rainfall)
Cloud Services: AWS RDS, Thingspeak, Firebase, Azure SQL
Data Processing & Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
